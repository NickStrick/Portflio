                        {`I spent the last couple of years learning and teaching to code. After highschool, curious about coding, I completed some credits toward a computer science degree while i worked in retail. I spent free time creating small games, and looking for resources to learn more and find out what I could make. I followed small courses on coding through things such as Youtube, Udemy, or Watch and Code. I spent these past two years enrolled in Lambda School as a student and as a contract teaching assistant.

During my time as a student, I learned Full Stack web development and computer science fundamentals, along with an assortment of librarys, frameworks and algorithms. With that I created some pretty cool projects that Iâ€™m proud of. I was a contract worker for Lambda School as well, where I frist worked as a Team lead above students, leading daily meetings, solving any debugging issues, helping my students learn the cirriculum in javscript, java, and python. The times I was working on a project with a team, I was responsible with the relationship between the stakeholder and the team, and managed our planning. I also debugged and filled any gaps in the conribution to the project where nessesary. I spent most of my time in meetings getting to know my students and solving problems or planning with them and creating documentation.`}
