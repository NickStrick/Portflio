        contribution: `I was the sole developer for all things Softball Science. Ui, Fron-end, Back-end, Project planning. I learned a lot in the making of the Softball Science website. for starters, It allowed me to gain experience in customer feedback. Asking the user for stories about how they would like to use the app and what features would save them time and money. The customer is always right, ans it is crucial that whoever you are working with and for has felt heard. 

        The client asked me to build the ability to inject video into thier site and the ability to upload whatever files, images, and viedos they would like into the side. Seeing as this was a side project that was making me little money, I was initally reluctant to do such intensive and time consuming work for the client. However i reminded myself that there is not just monetary value to my work. There is educational, experiencial, and reputational value to my work, and that is what i focused my attention on. Allowing for a forgiving deadline, i started my work, created a plan to follow, and wrote a Node JS backend database to hold the client's data and configured the webstie to display videos where ever was desired. I completed the work long before deadline, and gained knowledge in Node JS and embeded videos that i hadn't known before. The client was happy with the work and Expressed much gratitude.
        
        In the end, I learned new Technical, Buisness, Planning, and Communication skills in the creation of Softball Science. And continue to suport my client to this day.`
