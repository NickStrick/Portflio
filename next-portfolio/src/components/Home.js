const summary2 = `I spent the last several years working as senior developer and mentor. Before that, I was leading and mentoring computer science students. After highschool, curious about coding, I completed some credits toward a computer science degree
while i worked in retail. I spent free time creating small games, studying C sharp and javascript,
and looking for resources to learn more and find out what I could make. I followed small courses on coding through things such as Youtube,
    Udemy, or Watch and Code. I spent these past two years enrolled in Lambda School as a student and as a contract teaching assistant.

    and computer science fundamentals, along with an assortment of librarys, frameworks and algorithms. With that I created some pretty cool projects that Iâ€™m proud of. 
    I was a contract worker for Lambda School as well, where I frist worked as a Team lead above students, leading daily meetings, solving any debugging issues, 
    helping my students learn the cirriculum in javscript, java, and python. The times I was working on a project with a team, I was responsible with the relationship between the stakeholder and the team,
    and managed our planning. I also debugged and filled any gaps in the conribution to the project where nessesary. I spent most of my time in meetings getting to know my students 
    and solving problems or planning with them and creating documentation.`;
